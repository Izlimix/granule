The following theorem associated with `everyOther` is falsifiable:
	∀ a1.0 : Type,n0.0 : ↑Nat,t2.0 : Type,t3.0 : ↑Nat,a1.1 : Type,n0.1 : ↑Nat,t2.1 : Type,t3.1 : ↑Nat . ((0..0 ≤ 0..1) ∧ (n0.1 + 1 = n0.0) ∧ (n0.0 + 1 = n) -> (1..1 ≤ 0..1) ∧ (1 + n0.2 = n) ∧ (n0.2 + 1 = n0.0 + 1) ∧ (0..1 ≤ 0..1) ∧ (n1 = n0.2))
